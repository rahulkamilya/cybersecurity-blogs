## Viruses
#### A virus usually comes as an attachment in an email that holds a virus payload, or the part of the malware that performs the malicious action. Once the victim opens the file, the device is infected.

## Ransomware
#### Ransomware is the malware version of a kidnapper’s ransom note. It typically works by locking or denying access to your device and your files until you pay a ransom to the hacker. Any individuals or groups storing critical information on their devices are at risk from the threat of ransomware.

## Spyware 
#### Spyware collects information about a device or network, then relays this data back to the attacker. Hackers typically use spyware such as Pegasus to monitor a person’s internet activity and harvest personal data, including login credentials, credit card numbers or financial information, for the purposes of fraud or identity theft.

## Adware
#### Adware’s job is to create revenue for the developer by subjecting the victim to unwanted advertisements. Common types of adware include free games or browser toolbars. They collect personal data about the victim, then use it to personalize the ads they display. Though most adware is legally installed, it’s certainly no less annoying than other types of malware.

## Trojan
#### Trojan malware infiltrates a victim’s device by presenting itself as legitimate software. Once installed, the Trojan activates, sometimes going so far as to download additional malware.

## Botnets
#### A botnet isn’t a type of malware, but a network of computers or computer code that can carry out or execute malware. Attackers infect a group of computers with malicious software known as “bots,” which are capable of receiving commands from their controller.
These computers then form a network, providing the controller access to a substantial degree of collective processing power, which can be used to coordinate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, send spam, steal data, and create fake ads on your browser.


># How do I know I’ve been infected with malware?

- Browser redirects, or when your web browser takes you to sites you did not intend visit !

># How can I protect myself from malware?
## Protect your devices:
- Keep your operating system and applications updated. Cybercriminals look for vulnerabilities in old or outdated software, so make sure you install updates as soon as they become available.
- Never click on a link in a popup. Simply close the message by clicking on “X” in the upper corner and navigate away from the site that generated it.
- Limit the number of apps on your devices. Only install apps you think you need and will use regularly. And if you no longer use an app, uninstall it. 
- Don’t lend out your phone or leave your devices unattended for any reason, and be sure to check their settings and apps. If your default settings have changed, or a new app has mysteriously appeared, it might be a sign that spyware has been installed.
## Be careful online:
- Avoid clicking on unknown links. Whether it comes via email, a social networking site or a text message, if a link seems unfamiliar, keep away from it.
- Beware of emails requesting personal information. If an email appears to come from your bank and instructs you to click a link and reset your password or access your account, don't click it. Go directly to your online banking site and log in there.
- Avoid risky websites, such as those offering free content.
